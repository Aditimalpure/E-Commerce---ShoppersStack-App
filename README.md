# E-Commerce---ShoppersStack-App
I have worked on a manual testing project for an e-commerce application named ShoppersStack, collaborating with a team of five people. In this project, I have tested the application's homepage to identify and resolve bugs, gaining valuable experience in real-world testing methodologies.
